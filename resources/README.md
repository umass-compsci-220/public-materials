## Material

Lecture records are posted on Moodle via Echo360. Additionally, there are [lecture notes](../materials/README.md) in this repository.

## Homework

Unfamiliar with VSCode? Here are some documents to help:

- [How do I run or debug my homework?](./homework/RUNNING_AND_DEBUGGING.md)
- [How do I test my homework?](./homework/TESTING.md)

In addition to the automated grading, **there may be manual grading** on homework. Manual grading on the first three homework will be lenient (if present); however, you can read how proceeding homeworks may be graded.

- [Guidelines on code patterns that you are to avoid](../guidelines/BAD_PRACTICES.md)

#### Holidays and Schedule Changes

During University scheduled Holidays, office hours will NOT be held unless otherwise noted. **When a different day’s class schedule is being followed, office hours will follow that schedule.** For example, if there was a holiday on Monday, then Tuesday might be designated to follow a Monday schedule. Thus a Monday office hour schedule applies. If any course staff is unable to hold their office hours, there will be announcement post made on Campuswire.

### Tutoring

There is individual tutoring available through the CICS tutoring system and the LRC Tutoring program.

[The CICS Tutoring program](https://cicstutoring.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new) is a great way to get individual support in a flexible way to review material, whether it’s as an overview, to clarify things for projects or exams, or just to talk to someone who has taken the course before. All CICS tutors have taken CS220 in the past and would love to help you out! To request tutoring, fill out the form. If you see an option to log in, you don’t need to - look for the button that says ‘submit a new ticket’ and follow from there.

[The LRC Tutoring program](https://www.umass.edu/lrc/) offers drop in tutoring sessions for CS220! You can go there to get help from a qualified student to help you with anything and everything.

### Supplemental Instruction

These are review sessions run by our supplemental instructor, where you will be able to review material as the course continues. If you are enrolled in CS220, you should see a CS220-SI course on Moodle. Locations, times, recordings, and worksheets should all be posted there.

The SI session are run by the library, independent from the course staff.
